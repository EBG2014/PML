### Practical Machine Learning Course Project
### Peer Reviewers Please read
##### These are the files for the Practical Machine Learning Course Project.
##### There are three files:

- **course_project.html** *The official "submission" for the project*
- **course_project.rmd**  *The R markdown rmd file that was run in R-studio*
- **course_project.md**   *The  R markdown file output as a markdown document (using knit2html() in the R console)*

##### The course_project.rmd file is the knitr file that creates both the html output and the markdown file (md) 
##### The html file is the official submission for the project.  However, though I tried innumberable attemps I could not get the gh-pages option to work.
##### Folks can review the html file - but it is hard to read because it is not compiled as I could not get the *gh-pages* to work - so you will need to download the repo **or**...
#### Please look at the markdown file version  **course_project.md**
###Many thanks!
